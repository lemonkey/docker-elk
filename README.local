Already forked repo.

Now creating image and uploading to docker hub.

Have since created launchctl script to load docker on startup but it doesn't seem to be working
from launchctl. Only if we run the start screen script manually does it work.

Note: abandoning idea of using AWS as docker requires too many resources for the free tiered EC2 instance.
